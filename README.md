# 🧠 Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Pipeline with MLOps

This repository implements a full-stack **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis System** integrated with modern **MLOps practices**. It processes incoming text data, predicts sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral), and deploys the model with automated CI/CD and monitoring for real-world production scenarios.

## ✨ Overview

This project aims to build an **end-to-end sentiment analysis system** capable of:

- Performing **real-time inference** on user-input text.
- Automating the build, test, and deployment pipeline using **Jenkins CI/CD**.
- Deploying the app using **Docker** for consistency and portability.
- Monitoring **model performance** over time with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Evidently AI**.
- Supporting both **notebook-based experimentation** and **production-grade APIs**.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarshthakur-850/sentiment-analysis-mlops.git
cd sentiment-analysis-mlops
🔧 Install Requirements
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🐳 Run with Docker
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t sentiment-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 sentiment-api
Now access the API at: http://localhost:8000/docs

🔁 CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
The Jenkinsfile automates the following stages:

Clone Repo – Pull latest version from GitHub

Build Stage – Install dependencies, run Docker build

Test Stage – Run unit/integration tests (optional)

Deploy Stage – Deploy container to server/port

Post-Deployment – Send Slack/Email notifications

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t sentiment-api .'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -d -p 8000:8000 sentiment-api'
            }
        }
    }

📈 Monitoring & Observability
Optional but recommended for production.

You can integrate:

📊 Prometheus: Collect metrics from FastAPI endpoints

📈 Grafana: Visual dashboards for performance, traffic, errors

📉 Evidently AI: Detect model drift, bias, and data issues

🧪 Model Training (Notebook)
The SentimentAnalysis.ipynb includes:

Text preprocessing with NLTK/spaCy

Feature extraction using:

TF-IDF

Word2Vec

BERT (optional)

Model training using:

Logistic Regression

SVM

Deep Learning (LSTM)

Evaluation using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Model serialization (.pkl) for FastAPI app usage

🛠️ Future Improvements
Add Redis for request caching

Integrate Kafka for real-time data streaming

Implement GitHub Actions alongside Jenkins

Improve BERT model integration for better accuracy

Add user feedback loop for active learning
