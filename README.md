# 📊 Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Pipeline with MLOps

This repository contains a **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Pipeline** that combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **MLOps tools** to automate model training, deployment, and monitoring. It is designed for scalability, reproducibility, and efficient real-time inference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time sentiment analysis using NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT)
- ✅ FastAPI-based REST API for prediction service
- ✅ Dockerized for portability
- ✅ Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- ✅ Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently AI)
- ✅ Google Colab-compatible training (`SentimentAnalysis.ipynb`)
- ✅ Modular and production-ready Python backend (`main.py`)

📈 Monitoring (Optional)
You can integrate Prometheus, Grafana, and Evidently AI to track:

Model drift

Response time

Accuracy and precision metrics over time

🧠 Model Training
You can retrain or experiment using the included Jupyter notebook:

Preprocessing and vectorization (TF-IDF/Word2Vec/BERT)

Training with logistic regression / SVM / LSTM

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
